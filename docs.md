ElixirBridge is an all-volunteer organization that provides resources and teaches free programming workshops in the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) programming language. As program of [Bridge Foundry](http://bridgefoundry.org/), every activity is designed as an outreach to people who are underrepresented in tech.

Our mission is to empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others.  Elixir is a new functional programming language.  While we believe that it will be a great first language, the initial curriculum is designed for people with some programming experience. The Elixir language was designed to be approachable while providing all the power of the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems. The number of developers using Elixir is still small, yet growing fast, and it is a great time to shape the future of this community, while leveraging our new skills to shape the world.

ElixirBridge was founded in August 2016 by Anna Neyzberg [@ANeyzb](https://twitter.com/ANeyzb) and Matt Mills [@photomattmills](https://twitter.com/photomattmills)
