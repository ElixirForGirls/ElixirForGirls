## About this fork

ElixirBrige for Girls is a fork of the original <a href="http://elixirbridge.org/">Elixir Bridge</a> initiative. We decided to fork this beautiful initiative in order to make the appropriate adjustements needed for running the <a href="#">Elixir Girls Stockholm 2019</a> event. We noticed the excelent material from the original initiative so we decided to not reinvent the wheel, but at the same time we wanted to move faster and a fork allowed us to do so. Still, we are willing to merge it as part of the
main ElixirBridge initiative, maybe as a subdivision.

## Original introduction

ElixirBridge is an all-volunteer organization that provides resources and teaches free programming workshops in the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) programming language. As program of [Bridge Foundry](http://bridgefoundry.org/), every activity is designed as an outreach to people who are underrepresented in tech.

Our mission is to empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others.  Elixir is a new functional programming language.  While we believe that it will be a great first language, the initial curriculum is designed for people with some programming experience. The Elixir language was designed to be approachable while providing all the power of the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems. The number of developers using Elixir is still small, yet growing fast, and it is a great time to shape the future of this community, while leveraging our new skills to shape the world.

ElixirBridge was founded in August 2016 by Anna Neyzberg [@ANeyzb](https://twitter.com/ANeyzb) and Matt Mills [@photomattmills](https://twitter.com/photomattmills)
