## About ElixirGirls
<a href="https://elixirgirls.com/">ElixirGirls</a> is an open initiative founded by [Cath Jones](https://twitter.com/CathJones0) aimed _"to make technology 
more approachable by creating a fun and friendly environment for people to come together and learn about Elixir, Phoenix and Functional Programming."_

**ElixirGirls Stockholm 2019** is sponsored by [Derivco Sports](https://es.linkedin.com/company/derivco-sports) and is planned to happend in 2019 in Stockholm.

## About this fork

**ElixirGirls Stockholm** website is a fork of the original <a href="http://elixirbridge.org/">Elixir Bridge</a> initiative. We decided to fork the documentation repo from that beautiful initiative
in order to not reinvent the wheel and move faster while doing the appropriate adjustements needed for running the <a href="#">Elixir Girls Stockholm 2019</a> event. We
hope that part of the improvements made on this fork can be included in the original ElixirBridge repository.

## About ElixirBridge

ElixirBridge is an all-volunteer organization that provides resources and teaches free programming workshops in the [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) programming language. As program of [Bridge Foundry](http://bridgefoundry.org/), every activity is designed as an outreach to people who are underrepresented in tech.

Our mission is to empower people with technology through teaching and facilitating access, enlarging the community of people who give back and teach others.  Elixir is a new functional programming language.  While we believe that it will be a great first language, the initial curriculum is designed for people with some programming experience. The Elixir language was designed to be approachable while providing all the power of the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems. The number of developers using Elixir is still small, yet growing fast, and it is a great time to shape the future of this community, while leveraging our new skills to shape the world.

ElixirBridge was founded in August 2016 by Anna Neyzberg [@ANeyzb](https://twitter.com/ANeyzb) and Matt Mills [@photomattmills](https://twitter.com/photomattmills)
