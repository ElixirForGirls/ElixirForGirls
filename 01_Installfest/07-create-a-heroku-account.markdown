### Create a Heroku Account

#### Step 1: Visit the Heroku web site

[http://heroku.com](http://heroku.com)

#### Step 2: Create an Account

Click the big **Sign Up** button

Enter your email address:

#### Step 3: Activate your account

Heroku will send you an activation email. Open it and click on the activation link. It will take you to the Heroku site. Enter and confirm your password. Hit Save.

#### Step 4: Install the Heroku toolbelt

Visit [https://toolbelt.heroku.com/]( https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) click the download link, and install

##### Verify

Type this in the terminal:

```
heroku version
```

Approximate expected result:

```
heroku-toolbelt/3.99.2 (x86_64-darwin10.8.0) ruby/1.9.3
heroku-cli/6.14.34-1fcf80e (darwin-x64) node-v8.6.0
You have no installed plugins.
```

* Windows users, if `heroku version` doesn't work, open a new terminal window after the Heroku installer has finished.

#### Step 5: Add your SSH key to your Heroku account

Type this in the terminal:

```
heroku keys:add
```

Enter your Heroku email and password, if prompted, and accept the defaults.

#### Step 6: Optional (Create a GitHub Account)

You can use GitHub to store your code online and access it from anywhere. This step isn't necessary to deploy your apps to the web though.

##### Step 6.1: Visit the GitHub web site

[https://github.com](https://github.com)

##### Step 6.2: Create an Account

Enter a username, your email address and a password. Click the green **Sign Up for GitHub** button.

{:.message.important.vertical-centerer}
  Use the same email address below for Heroku, git, GitHub, and ssh. Be sure to use an email account you can log into immediately.

##### Step 6.3: Select a plan
GitHub provides several levels of account plans but you can create unlimited public/private repositories with a free plan so for now, you can select that one. Hit the **Continue** button, and skip the next step if you see it (with a survey).

##### Step 6.4: Copy the SSH Key for you GitHub account

Adding an SSH key to GitHub allows you to pull and push data without typing in your password all the time. First we'll copy the key we generated in the chapter titled **Create an SSH Key**, and add it to your GitHub account. We'll use a terminal command to do that, so that we don't add any newlines or whitespace that could cause an error.

- Mac users

  Type this in the terminal:

  ```
  pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

- Linux users

  Type this in the terminal:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install xclip
  xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```

  The first line (`sudo apt-get install xclip`) installs a tiny application, xclip, that lets us copy the contents of a file without opening it. Mac and Windows users have similar things already installed (pbcopy and clip).

- Windows users

  Type this in the terminal:

  ```
  clip < "%userprofile%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub"
  ```

Now that you have copied the key to your clipboard, you can add it to the GitHub account you created earlier.

##### Step 6.5: Add your SSH key to GitHub

Navigate to [github.com](https://github.com) and make sure you are logged in. On any page on the GitHub site, click your profile photo in the top right corner to the right of the plus sign. In the drop-down menu, click **Settings** to go to the account settings page.

On the account settings page, select **SSH and GPG keys** from the column on the left.

At the top right of this page, click the button that says **New SSH key**. In the title field, give a name for your SSH key, you might call it **My PC** or **Personal MacBook**. In the key field, paste the key you copied.

Click **Add SSH key**

Confirm the action by providing your GitHub Password

##### Step 6.6: Confirm SSH Authentication

Confirm that you have successfully set up SSH Authentication for GitHub. Note that Windows users cannot perform this step.

Type this in the terminal:

```
ssh -T git@github.com
```
Expected Result:

```
The authenticity of host 'github.com (207.97.227.239)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```
You might see a message like this to confirm your key. If it's your correct key, continue connecting by typing the word _yes_

Expected Result:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```
