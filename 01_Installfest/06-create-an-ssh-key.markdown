### Step 10: Create an SSH Key

An SSH key uniquely identifies you (and your computer) when your computer is communicating with other computers. Think of an SSH key as a type of password.


#### Step 10.1: Check for an existing key

Let's see if you have a pre-existing SSH key on your computer - you might have one from a previous RailsBridge or ElixirBridge workshop you have been to. Type this in the terminal:

```
ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
If you see the message `No such file or directory`, we need to generate an SSH Key. Otherwise skip ahead to the next chapter, **Create a Heroku Account**.

#### Step 10.2: Generate an SSH Key

{:.message.important.vertical-centerer}
  Use the same email address below for Heroku, git, GitHub, and ssh.

Type this in the terminal:


```
ssh-keygen -C your_email@example.com -t rsa
```

Press enter to accept the default key save location.

Next you'll be asked for a passphrase.

##### Option 1: No passphrase
Hit enter to accept a blank passphrase, then hit enter again.

##### Option 2: Passphrase
If your computer is shared with other people, as in a work laptop, you should choose and enter a real passphrase. Twice.

After the key generation is complete, your output should look like this:

```text
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/student/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/Users/student/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/student/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/student/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
88:54:ab:77:fe:5c:c3:7s:14:37:28:8c:1d:ef:2a:8d student@example.com
```

#### Step 10.3: Verify

Your brand-new public key is now stored at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

##### Public vs. Private Keys

If you look inside `~/.ssh/`, you will notice two files with the same name: `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`.

* `id_rsa.pub` is your **public key** and can be shared freely.
* `id_rsa` is your **private key** and must be kept secret.

Add your generated public key to the authentication agent using the following command:

Type this in the terminal:

```text
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Expected Result

```text
Enter passphrase for /Users/student/.ssh/id_rsa:
Identity added: /Users/student/.ssh/id_rsa (/Users/student/.ssh/id_rsa)"
```

If you did not see any errors, we're done! You can continue with the next chapter.

#### Troubleshooting

If you saw this error:

```
Could not open a connection to your authentication agent
```

It's possible your ssh-agent is not running. Here are a few commands that you can try to use to start the ssh-agent:

- For some Windows machines:

  ```
  eval `ssh-agent -s`
  ```

- For others (confirmed on some Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 setups):

  ```
  eval $(ssh-agent)
  ```

- For Linux:

  ```
  eval `ssh-agent`
  ```
